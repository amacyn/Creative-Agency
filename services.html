        <p>Mandela describes his education at a Thembu college called Clarkebury, and later at the strict Healdtown school, where students were rigorously put in routines. He mentions his education at the University of Fort Hare, and his practice of law later on. He also writes; "Democracy meant all men to be heard, and the decision was taken together as a people. Majority rule was a foreign notion. A minority was not to be clashed by a majority.</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            The graphic designing tools are ideal to create a prototype of a website. These tools let front-end developers experiment and test the user interface before working out the actual code.

            <h2>Development</h2>
            The main benefit of front-end development is its speed because of the modern framework and innovations. The quick development makes the entire process simple. For example, when you work on an app for which the backend is ready, development can be done easily.

            <h2>Marketing</h2>
            Modern sites and apps cannot afford to ignore their space in the digital world. Furthermore, the front-end developers are using different frameworks according to the clientâ€™s budget.

            <h2>App Development</h2>
            Using modern frameworks will make you able to develop elements faster. Therefore, if you have a plan for app development, you should connect with front-end developers.

            <h2>Error Fixing</h2>
            There are some languages like java and PHP that have been introduced not so long back. These languages sometimes show immature behavior that results in small-sized knowledge. Few developers are against these features. But, you can resolve such flaws by using a specific technology.
